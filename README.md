# Image Processing and Analysis Project

This GitHub project is designed to perform basic image preprocessing and analysis on a collection of images using Python and various libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to process images, extract contours, and analyze mean intensity variations along the width of the images.
